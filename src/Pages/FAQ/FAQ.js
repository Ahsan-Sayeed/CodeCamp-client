        <h2>Can I invest in CodeCamp?</h2>
        <p>
          We are a public charity, so technically you already own CodeCamp.
          Nobody can own shares of a public charity, and it cannot be bought or
          sold. So you'll continue to own a part of CodeCamp whether you like it
          or not. ðŸ˜‰ This said, we would welcome your donations. The only way
          you can directly influence CodeCamp, though, is to roll up your
          sleeves and contribute to our project.

        <h2>Does CodeCamp have a mobile app?</h2>
        <p>
          We are building a fully-featured Android app. In the meantime, you can
          learn on the go by watching CodeCamp's YouTube channel. And if you
          want a mobile app designed specifically for learning to code, we
          recommend Grasshopper. It's free and designed by a CodeCamp
          contributor and her team. You can download it on iOS or Android.
